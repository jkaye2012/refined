Simple [refinement types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_type) for Rust.

For detailed information, please see the [documentation on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/refined/latest).

## Quickstart

The [basic usage example on docs.rs](file:///home/jkaye/git/refined/target/doc/refined/index.html#basic-usage)
is a minimal example that should be easy to follow.

You can also use the [examples](https://github.com/jkaye2012/refined/examples) to get started. Each example is
a complete cargo project of its own. They are meant to be run with `cargo run` so that you can view their output
and reference it against the code.
